To-Do List Website

 Description:

The To-Do List website is a simple, intuitive application designed to help users manage their daily tasks effectively. This project is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a lightweight and responsive interface without relying on any external libraries or frameworks. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as complete, all within a clean and user-friendly environment.

 Key Features:

1.Task Creation and Management:
  - Easily add new tasks by entering a task name and optional details.
  - Edit existing tasks to update their content.
  - Delete tasks that are no longer needed.

 2.Task Status Tracking:
  - Mark tasks as complete with a single click.
  - Visual differentiation between completed and pending tasks.

3.Responsive Design:
  - The website is fully responsive and works smoothly on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
  
4.Persistent Data Storage:
  - If implemented, tasks are saved locally using the browserâ€™s `localStorage`, so users can close the browser and return to their task list later without losing data.

Technologies Used:

- HTML: Provides the basic structure of the website, defining the elements and content layout.
  
- CSS: Handles the styling and layout of the website, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive. Flexbox and media queries are used for the responsive design.
